# Numerical Analysis from scratch

This repository is my implementation of some basic numerical analysis topics written in C#/.NET. 
I intend to not use any libraries to start with, thus I do intend to write the Linear Algebra functionality
on my own as well. 

I know that there are various libraries out there, that will most likely do a much better job at
executing all the necessary computations, but now I am forced to learn some more aspects of the 
computational mathematics field.

## Implemented

- Dense Column/Row vector data structure
- Dense Matrix data structure (row-major only)
- Some simple matrix vector arithmetics (nothing optimized)
- _LU/PLU_ factorization
- Determinant and solution of **Ax=b** problems using LU
